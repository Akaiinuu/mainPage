## About myself

I have 5 years of experience in tech companies working as QA engineer and System Analyst. I am always highly involved in a project. I quickly adapt to new projects and I am able to work in critical situations. I always try to get knowledge about the QA Engineer profession and have basic knowledge in automating testing, API and UI on Java. I constantly improve my skills and study new instruments and practices. I also have an experience mentoring people on how to become a QA engineer. Two of my students got a job and succeeded in a big tech company. In my free time I go to the gym, watch movies and TV shows, and paint Warhammer miniatures.
